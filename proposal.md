# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Swords and Magic

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The project will be a fighting similator that utilized a combo system with a slight hint of ragdoll physics

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will be running on Unreal engine 5, utilizing the engine's new and faster loading times and graphical rendering. Within the game itself there will be ragdoll physics accompanied with basic combo mechanics. The Game will also include an Ai for the player to fight against that will utilize the same mechanics that the player is given.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Physics based ragdoll mechanics
combo system
Ai enemies'
Magic system
good final propject will be a fully completed combo system with ragdoll mechanics

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Better outcome would be a fully completed combo system with radoll mechanics which can be tested against an enemy Ai

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best outcome would be a fully completed combo abd magic system with ragdoll mechanics which can be tested against an enemy Ai

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I'll need to acquire skills on Unreal engine blueprints to be able to fully script the combo mechanics and AI enemy. I'll also need to learn a bit about character animations to create fluid combat and movement. Skills in Vfx will only be needed for the magic system but would only be learned if the base mechanics of the game are finalized. Ragdoll mechanics will be a necessary skill to learn for the base combat mechanics of the game, and will have to be prioritized within the project scope.
